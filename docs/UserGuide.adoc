By: `Team Concierge(TM)`      Since: `Aug 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Introduction

Concierge(TM) is created for *hotel managers and receptionists* of small hotels looking for a simple application to *assist
the user in hotel management*. More importantly, Concierge(TM) is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface*
(CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Concierge(TM) can get your
hotel management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `concierge.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Concierge(TM).
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list -r`* : lists all rooms
* **`checkin`**`r/001` : checks in the first booking of room 001
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Terminology]]
== Terminology
Some important things that you should know before using Concierge(TM)

====

* Room numbers must be a *3-digit number from 001 to 100*. For example,
** 001, 050, 074, 100 are valid
** 000, 01, 99, 101 are invalid

* The format used for dates is *d/M/y*, whereby
** `d` - Day can be 1 or 2 digits
** `M` - Month can be 1 or 2 digits
** `y` - Year can be 2 or 4 digits (if 2 digits, date is assumed to be in the current century)

* A `Booking` ...
** is *Active* if the period between its start and end date includes today's date, inclusively.
** is *Upcoming* if its start date is strictly after today's date.
** is *Expired* if its end date is strictly before today's date.
** is *Outdated* if its start date is strictly before today's date.
** is *Overlapping* with another booking if its start date is strictly before the other's end date AND the other's start date is strictly before its end date
** can be uniquely identified by its start date.

* There are 2 guest lists:
** *Checked-in guest list* contains all the guests who are currently checked-in.
** *Archived guest list* contains all guests who have ever stayed in the hotel before.
** Therefore, it is possible for a guest who has made a booking to be in
*** neither lists - guest has yet to check-in and has never stayed in the hotel before
*** checked-in guest list only - guest has checked-in and has never stayed in the hotel before
*** archived guest list only - guest has checked-in and has stayed in the hotel before
*** both lists - guest has checked-in and has stayed in the hotel before

the booking is valid.
* A guest can make a booking for however long he/ she wants.
* When adding a booking, the guest will *not* be added to the archived guest list or checked-in guest list.
His/ her information will be stored under his/ her booking in the room.

19/12/18.

When a booking is added and it starts today (i.e. it is active), then you can
 preview the booking on the left room pane.

//tag::checkin[]
=== Check-in room: `checkin` image:icon-key.png[width="32"]

[cols="^.^1,<.^5a", frame=none]

|
* If the guest does not have any other checked-in bookings, then he/she will be removed from the checked-in

* <<Adding a new account, More users can be added>> at `passwords.json`.
* [v2.0] You can create new accounts via the Concierge(TM) app.
****

[TIP]
A login allows the user to access the commands which can affect the
bookings.

Commands which require login:

* <<Adding a guest: `add`, `add`>>
* <<Check-in room: `checkin`, `checkin`>>
* <<Checkout room: `checkout`, `checkout`>>
* <<Reassigning a guest to another room : `reassign`, `reassign`>>
* <<Provide Room Service: `service`, `service`>>
* <<Clearing all entries : `clear`, `clear`>>

Example: `login user/damithz pw/forgotpassword`

.Without login, Concierge(TM) cannot be cleared
image::LogInCommand-notsignedin.png[width="600"]

.Login with a valid account
image::LogInCommand-loginsuccess.png[width="600"]

.After sign in, `clear` command can now be executed
image::LogInCommand-clearsuccess.png[width="600"]

==== Adding a new account

 Currently, Concierge(TM) does not have a feature for users to add an account via
the app. The reason is because we only _read_ from the password file.
Nevertheless, for the adventurous users who want to create their own
accounts, this sub-section will be useful.

* Step 1: Open the `passwords.json` file, which should be in the same
folder as your Concierge(TM).jar file.

.The `passwords.json` file stores a list of hashed passwords
image::LogInCommand-passwordsfile.png[width="900"]

* Step 2: Concierge(TM) uses SHA-256 password hashing. This hash can be
generated using this https://passwordsgenerator.net/sha256-hash-generator/[tool].

.Enter your password in the field to generate the hash
image::LogInCommand-generatehash.png[width="900"]

[NOTE]
 Concierge(TM) was designed to work with alphanumeric usernames and passwords in
 mind. Do not enter symbols (!, @, %...)

* Step 3: Add the entry to the `passwords.json` file. Note that entries are
separate with a comma.
Format: `"username" : "hashedPassword"`

.A new account with username "newUser" and password "mySecurePassw0rd" has been added
image::LogInCommand-addpasswordentry.png[width="900"]

* Step 4: Close and reload the Concierge(TM) application, and your new account
will be recognised.

.User is now able to sign in with the new account
image::LogInCommand-newloginsuccess.png[width="900"]

=== Logout : `logout`

Logs out of the Concierge(TM) application. +
Format: `logout`

* The special classes of commands (as documented in <<Login : `login`,
login>>) can no longer be
executed.
* The `logout` command will erase the command history, so users cannot undo/
redo commands executed before the logout.
** This achieves the same effect as closing and re-opening Concierge(TM) in the
midst of a sign-in session.

Example: `logout`

image::LogOutCommand-success.png[width="400"]

// end::loginlogout[]

=== Selecting a guest : `select`

Selects the guest or room identified by the index number used in the displayed list. +
Format: `select INDEX`

****
* Selects the guest or room and displays its information in the detailed panel on the right.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* `1, 2, 3, ...`
****

Examples:

* `list -g` +
`select 2` +
Selects the 2nd guest in the displayed list.
* `list -r` +
`select 100` +
Selects the 100th room in the displayed list.

=== Provide Room Service: `service` image:icon-key.png[width="32"]

Charges a room service to a room  +
Format: `service r/ROOM_NUMBER no/ITEM_NUMBER [c/COST]`

****
* ITEM_NUMBER refers to the number in the menu given to each type of service offered by the hotel.
* This could be room service, on-demand video streaming, bath supplies, mini bar, etc.
* The cost can be specified as well, if the guest is to be charged an amount that is
  different from the cost in the menu. Note that the cost has to follow a strict format
  such as 100.00, i.e. with two decimal places. The dollar part of the cost should also
  not exceed `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.
* Any expenses added with this command will be accounted for under the Expenses portion
  of the respective rooms.
* Only occupied rooms (i.e. rooms with checked-in guests) can have expenses charged to it.
* The default `Menu` that comes with Concierge(TM) consists of the following items. Items
  may be modified, added, or removed through `concierge.xml`.
** *RS01* -- Room service: Red wine -- $50.00
** *RS02* -- Room service: Beef steak -- $70.00
** *RS03* -- Room service: Thai massage -- $100.00
** *MB01* -- Minibar: Coca cola -- $3.00
** *MB02* -- Minibar: Sprite -- $3.00
** *MB03* -- Minibar: Tiger beer -- $6.00
** *MB04* -- Minibar: Mineral water -- $3.00
** *SP01* -- Swimming pool: Entry -- $5.00
****

Examples:

* `service r/085 no/RS01` +
Adds an expenditure of the item *RS01* to the room's expenses.

* `service r/096 no/RS03 c/12.34` +
Adds an expenditure of the item *RS03* to the room's expenses and charge $12.34 for it.
